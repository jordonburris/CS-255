# CS-255

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
 - The driver pass project was a project that that was a web application that would allow students to take practice driver exams and schedule driving time with an instructor.

What did you do particularly well?
 - I feel some of the documentation I did well on, and making the slides seems pretty simple and straight forward.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
 - I feel like I could have done a better job on the graphs, I feel as I did not go into as much detail as I should have in the graphs.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
 - I woudl write them down point by point and see which one would mean the most to them. I feel like it is important because they are going to be the one using the application so at the end of the day you would always want the customer satisfied.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
 - I use a pretty simple approach, I try and break things down piece by piece and work on them slowly that way, so I don't get confused and can focus on each piece.
